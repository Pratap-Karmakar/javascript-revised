    <h1>there are two types of data in javascript</h1>
    <h3>1. primitive type -- null,number,string,boolean,undefine</h3>
    <h3>2. reference type -- [], {}, ()  ->   array, object, function</h3>

<script>
    let a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
    console.log('the values of a',a);
    let b=a;
    console.log('the values of b',b)     // it will give the value as same as what is having a

    b.pop();    // but if we want to change a value from b
    console.log(b)
    console.log(a)  // but if we want to change a value from b, then we can see that the values of b is changed but the values of a is change at the same time with b. 

    // because 'b = a'    means we are not copying the values of 'a' into 'b', basically we are usig the values of a into b

    // to overcome this porblem and to copy an array in to another variable we use spread operator '...'
    let m = [1,2,3,4]
    console.log('the values of m',m);

    let n = [...m]   // here we've used spread operators to copy the values of 'm' into 'n'
    console.log('the values of n',n);

    n.pop();   // now we are changing the value of 'n' where values are copied from 'm'

    console.log('after changing the values of n', n)
    console.log('after changing the values of n printing m', m)   // here we can see that the values of m is still the same because of the spread operator


    console.log(typeof null);
