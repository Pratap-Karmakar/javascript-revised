    <h1>Stack and Heap Memory</h1>
    
    <h2>Primirtive datatypes are use Stack and Reference or non primitive data types are use Heap memory</h2>

    <h3>When we use Stack memore then we get a copy of that variable or anything what we've declared and when we use Heap memory then we get the reference of that variable or anything what we've declared</h3>

        console.log('name : ',name)  // here it will print youtube, because it's value is remain the same because the we changed the value of anotherName and anotherName is having a copy as the value of the name variable.
