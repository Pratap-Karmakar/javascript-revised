    <h1>Array</h1>
  
    <h4>we can store only one value in a variable, but if we want to store more than one valu in a single variable then we use 'array'</h4>


<script>

    let anything = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    console.log(anything)
    console.log(anything[1]);

    anything.push(2)            // it will add a value at the last index of the array 
    anything.pop()             // it will remove a value at the last index of the array 
    anything.unshift(6)       // it will add new value 6 at the 0th index which is at the very first of the array
    anything.shift()         // it will remove a value at the first index of the array 
    anything.splice(2,2)    // it will remove the 2th index item and also the next 2 item. means 2th index is 1 value and the other 2 will be the next value. so total values will be 3
